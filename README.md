Product Feature Monitoring and A/B Testing

This project simulates a product feature monitoring and A/B testing workflow. Using a Python-based approach, it demonstrates how to evaluate the impact of a new feature on user engagement metrics. This workflow includes data simulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization, making it a valuable example for data science and analytics roles.
Project Overview

Discord is a platform with millions of users, and understanding user engagement is crucial to enhancing the user experience. This project simulates an A/B testing setup where user engagement metrics (e.g., time spent and session count) are tracked and analyzed pre- and post-exposure to a new feature. The main objectives are to:

    Simulate data for a control and test group of users.
    Calculate pre- and post-feature engagement metrics.
    Conduct statistical analysis using a t-test to determine if the feature has a significant impact.
    Visualize the results with distributions and boxplots.

Features

    Data Simulation: Generates synthetic user data with control and test groups, engagement metrics, and demographic details.
    A/B Testing: Conducts t-test analysis to evaluate the impact of the feature on engagement metrics.
    Data Visualization: Provides visualizations to compare engagement metrics between control and test groups.

Setup and Requirements
Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.5 or later). You'll also need the following libraries:

    pandas
    numpy
    scipy
    matplotlib
    seaborn

To install the required libraries, run:

bash

pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn

Files

    product_feature_monitoring_and_ab_testing.py: The main Python script that performs data simulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.
    README.md: Project documentation.

Usage

    Clone this repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-feature-monitoring-ab-testing.git
cd product-feature-monitoring-ab-testing

Run the main script:

bash

    python product_feature_monitoring_and_ab_testing.py

    Observe the printed baseline and post-exposure metrics, as well as the results of the t-test for statistical significance.

    View the visualizations generated in matplotlib, which compare post-exposure engagement metrics between the control and test groups.

Explanation of Analysis Steps
Step 1: Data Simulation

The script begins by generating synthetic data for 1000 users, split into control (Group A) and test (Group B). User engagement metrics such as session count and time spent are simulated with slight variations to reflect potential impact from the feature.
Step 2: Baseline and Post-Exposure Metrics

For each group, pre- and post-feature averages are calculated, providing a baseline for comparison.
Step 3: A/B Testing (T-Test)

The script uses a t-test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in user engagement between the control and test groups after exposure to the feature.
Step 4: Data Visualization

Two visualizations are created:

    Distribution Plot: A comparison of post-exposure time spent distributions for the control and test groups.
    Boxplot: A side-by-side view of the engagement metrics for each group.

Example Output

Sample outputs and visualizations will include baseline/post-exposure metrics, t-test statistics, and plots showing the difference between groups.
Sample Text Output

sql

Baseline Metrics:
Control Group - Avg Time Spent (Pre): 30.2
Test Group - Avg Time Spent (Pre): 30.5

Post-Exposure Metrics:
Control Group - Avg Time Spent (Post): 32.1
Test Group - Avg Time Spent (Post): 34.5

A/B Test Results:
T-Statistic: 2.15, P-Value: 0.031
The difference is statistically significant.

Sample Visualizations

    Distribution Plot: Shows the density of time spent by users in the control vs. test group.
    Boxplot: Provides a visual summary of the post-exposure time spent data, highlighting any differences between the two groups.

Potential Improvements

    Real Data Integration: Integrate with real user data (if available) to conduct more meaningful analysis.
    Automated Reporting: Generate automated summaries or dashboards for presenting findings.
    Additional Metrics: Include more advanced user engagement metrics for deeper insights.

Step 2: Data Collection and SQL Queries

Using SQL, write queries to calculate baseline metrics and any necessary aggregations for analysis. Here are some example queries:

    Calculate Baseline Metrics for Both Groups:

    sql
    SELECT group_id, AVG(time_spent) AS avg_time_spent, AVG(session_count) AS avg_session_count
    FROM user_data
    WHERE pre_exposure = TRUE
    GROUP BY group_id;

Post-Exposure Data for Analysis:
    
    SELECT group_id, AVG(time_spent) AS avg_time_spent, AVG(session_count) AS avg_session_count, AVG(feature_interactions) AS avg_feature_interactions
    FROM user_data
    WHERE post_exposure = TRUE
    GROUP BY group_id;

Behavioral Insights from Social Graph Analysis

This project uses Python and the NetworkX library to analyze a simulated social graph of user interactions. The goal is to uncover insights into user behaviors, detect influential users, and identify community structures within a network. This kind of analysis is useful for social media platforms, online gaming communities, and other interactive platforms to better understand user engagement and improve community building.

Project Overview

The custom ETL pipeline consists of three main stages:

    Extract: Load raw data from a CSV file.
    Transform: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
    Load: Store the transformed data in an SQLite database.

This project can serve as a foundation for more complex ETL processes, suitable for data analysis, reporting, and machine learning tasks.
Features

    Data Extraction: Reads data from a specified CSV file.
    Data Transformation: Cleans data by removing duplicates and filling missing values.
    Data Loading: Loads cleaned data into an SQLite database.
    Logging: Tracks the ETL process for easier debugging and monitoring.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    pandas - For data manipulation
    sqlite3 - For database interactions

To install the required packages, run:

bash

pip install pandas

Setup

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-etl-pipeline.git
cd custom-etl-pipeline

Prepare your data by placing a CSV file named data.csv in the project directory.

Run the ETL pipeline:

bash

    python custom_etl_pipeline.py

Project Structure

├── custom_etl_pipeline.py   # Main script for the ETL process
├── data.csv                 # Sample raw data file
└── README.md                # Project documentation

Usage

The ETL pipeline can be executed directly, and it will process the specified CSV file, perform transformations, and save the results in an SQLite database.
Results

After running the script, you’ll find an SQLite database named etl_database.db, which contains a table transformed_data with the cleaned data ready for analysis.
Future Improvements

    More Transformation Functions: Add additional transformation capabilities (e.g., data type conversion, aggregations).
    Integration with Other Databases: Expand support for other databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.
    Scheduling: Implement scheduling to run the ETL process automatically at specified intervals.
    Data Validation: Add validation checks to ensure data integrity and quality.
